        **Use Case:**
        - **File Upload:** Users can upload two files, File 463 and File 322, in CSV or Excel formats containing specific employee financial data.
        - **Reconciliation Process:** The application reconciles data based on the EMPLOYEE number, merging the data and calculating the final amount for each matching employee.
        - **Data Structuring:** The result includes details such as employee number, name, final amount, deduction codes, vendor names, and initial amounts from both files.
        - **Display and Download Options:** Users can view the number of records and the first 50 reconciliations, and download the complete reconciled data in CSV or Excel format.
